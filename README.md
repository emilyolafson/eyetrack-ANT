**Title:** Relating eye-tracking metrics to attention network systems

**Project lead:** Emily Olafson, mattermost: @emilyo email: olafsonemily@gmail.com

**Project Description:** This project involves analysis eye-tracking data that was recorded during the Attention Network Task, a paradigm used to assess different components of attention. Each of the primary attention systems—alerting, orienting, and executive control monitoring—involves salient autonomic correlates as evidenced by changes in reactive pupil dilation and blinks. The goal of the project will be to understand how physiological correlates of attention vary in healthy individuals and in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The data consists of eyetracking outputs in the form of .edf files which include pupil dilation and eye-blinks, as well as accompanying behavioural data (Attention Network Task) including measures like reaction time. The data was collected by Dr. Sudhin Shah at Weill Cornell Medicine and needs to be preprocessed (see Issues)

**Skills:** Python or MATLAB skills at any level, statistics, familiarity with eyetracking software and/or analysis.
